class MaskRCNN(FasterRCNN):
    """
    Implements Mask R-CNN.

    The input to the model is expected to be a list of tensors, each of shape [C, H, W], one for each
    image, and should be in 0-1 range. Different images can have different sizes.

    The behavior of the model changes depending if it is in training or evaluation mode.

    During training, the model expects both the input tensors, as well as a targets (list of dictionary),
    containing:
        - boxes (``FloatTensor[N, 4]``): the ground-truth boxes in ``[x1, y1, x2, y2]`` format, with
          ``0 <= x1 < x2 <= W`` and ``0 <= y1 < y2 <= H``.
        - labels (Int64Tensor[N]): the class label for each ground-truth box
        - masks (UInt8Tensor[N, H, W]): the segmentation binary masks for each instance

    The model returns a Dict[Tensor] during training, containing the classification and regression
    losses for both the RPN and the R-CNN, and the mask loss.

    During inference, the model requires only the input tensors, and returns the post-processed
    predictions as a List[Dict[Tensor]], one for each input image. The fields of the Dict are as
    follows:
        - boxes (``FloatTensor[N, 4]``): the predicted boxes in ``[x1, y1, x2, y2]`` format, with
          ``0 <= x1 < x2 <= W`` and ``0 <= y1 < y2 <= H``.
        - labels (Int64Tensor[N]): the predicted labels for each image
        - scores (Tensor[N]): the scores or each prediction
        - masks (UInt8Tensor[N, 1, H, W]): the predicted masks for each instance, in 0-1 range. In order to
          obtain the final segmentation masks, the soft masks can be thresholded, generally
          with a value of 0.5 (mask >= 0.5)

    Args:
        backbone (nn.Module): the network used to compute the features for the model.
            It should contain a out_channels attribute, which indicates the number of output
            channels that each feature map has (and it should be the same for all feature maps).
            The backbone should return a single Tensor or and OrderedDict[Tensor].
        num_classes (int): number of output classes of the model (including the background).
            If box_predictor is specified, num_classes should be None.
        min_size (int): minimum size of the image to be rescaled before feeding it to the backbone
        max_size (int): maximum size of the image to be rescaled before feeding it to the backbone

            They are generally the mean values of the dataset on which the backbone has been trained
            on
        image_std (Tuple[float, float, float]): std values used for input normalization.
            They are generally the std values of the dataset on which the backbone has been trained on
        rpn_anchor_generator (AnchorGenerator): module that generates the anchors for a set of feature
            maps.

        rpn_nms_thresh (float): NMS threshold used for postprocessing the RPN proposals
        rpn_fg_iou_thresh (float): minimum IoU between the anchor and the GT box so that they can be
            considered as positive during training of the RPN.
        rpn_bg_iou_thresh (float): maximum IoU between the anchor and the GT box so that they can be
            considered as negative during training of the RPN.
        rpn_batch_size_per_image (int): number of anchors that are sampled during training of the RPN
            for computing the loss
        rpn_positive_fraction (float): proportion of positive anchors in a mini-batch during training
            of the RPN
        rpn_score_thresh (float): during inference, only return proposals with a classification score
            greater than rpn_score_thresh
        box_roi_pool (MultiScaleRoIAlign): the module which crops and resizes the feature maps in
            the locations indicated by the bounding boxes
        box_head (nn.Module): module that takes the cropped feature maps as input
        box_predictor (nn.Module): module that takes the output of box_head and returns the
            classification logits and box regression deltas.
        box_score_thresh (float): during inference, only return proposals with a classification score
            greater than box_score_thresh

        box_detections_per_img (int): maximum number of detections per image, for all classes.

            considered as negative during training of the classification head
        box_batch_size_per_image (int): number of proposals that are sampled during training of the
            classification head
        box_positive_fraction (float): proportion of positive proposals in a mini-batch during training
            of the classification head
        bbox_reg_weights (Tuple[float, float, float, float]): weights for the encoding/decoding of the
            bounding boxes
        mask_roi_pool (MultiScaleRoIAlign): the module which crops and resizes the feature maps in

        mask_head (nn.Module): module that takes the cropped feature maps as input
        mask_predictor (nn.Module): module that takes the output of the mask_head and returns the
            segmentation mask logits
